		<h1>Prague - Hub of Baroque Building</h1> 

		<p>Prague is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic and the historical capital of Bohemia. It is a political, cultural, and economic hub of central Europe, with a rich history and a rich architectural heritage that reflects both the uncertain currents of history in Bohemia and an urban life extending back more than 1,000 years.  With a population of about 1.3 million people, Prague has a temperate oceanic climate, with relatively warm summers and chilly winters. It was the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia and residence of several Holy Roman Emperors, most notably Charles IV.</p>
